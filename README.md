# The Cycle: Frontier - Item Tracker

This app is designed to keep track of what items are needed for quests and upgrades in The Cycle: Frontier. Once you know how many of everything you need, you know what you can rest easy selling or giving to your friends. It also serves as a comprehensive quest objective list. It was built using create-react-app with Typescript. Data is stored in local browser storage. There are no analytics. While this app is open source, I do not give anyone permission to fork or reuse this code for purposes other than education or contributing to this project.

## Known issues.

- Some items may have incorrect names. Let me know if an item doesn't use its in-game name.

## Upcoming features

- Icons for items
- Better
