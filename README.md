# The Cycle: Frontier - Item Tracker

This app is designed to keep track of what items are needed for missions and upgrades in The Cycle: Frontier. Once you know how many of everything you need, you know what you can rest easy selling or giving to your friends. It also serves as a comprehensive mission objective list. It was built using create-react-app with Typescript. Data is stored in local browser storage. While this app is open source, I do not give anyone permission to fork or reuse this code for purposes other than education or contributing to this project.

## Known issues.

- Some quantities or items may be incorrect - if you see a discrepancy, please submit an issue or PR.

## Upcoming features

- Icons and rarity for items
- A way to show only items needed for the next N steps of an upgrade or mission
